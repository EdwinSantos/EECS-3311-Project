Error messages and their associations (not definitive, tested from oracle):

New tracker: E1 (new_tracker on tracker with *containers*),E2,E3,E4
New phase: E5,E6,E7,E8
New container: E5,E9,E10,E11,E12,E13,E14,E18
Move container: E9?, E13, E15, E16
Remove container: E15
Remove Phase: E1 (if there are containers),E9

new_tracker doesnt wipe the board (existing phases stayed), but new_tracker does prevent undo to previous state

note: on program start tracker should already exist with values 0,0

new_tracker still has to wipe history
