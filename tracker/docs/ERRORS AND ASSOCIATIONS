Error messages and their associations (not definitive, tested from oracle):

Implemented/tested:

Implemented/not tested:
New tracker: Functionality, Undo,E1 (new_tracker on tracker with *containers*),E2,E3,E4
New phase: Functionality, Undo,E1,E5,E6,E7,E8
New container: E5,E9,E10,E11,E12,E13,E14,E18
Remove container: Functionality, E15
Remove Phase: E1 (if there are containers),E9

In progress:
New Container: functionality, adding rad and capacity+1 to the phase it was directed to.
Undo for: new container, move container, remove phase, remove container
Move container: E9?, E13, E15, E16
Move container also needs its basic functionality still 
Undo for each operation (Redo should ultimately just call the execute method for the respective operation)

Other todo:
- does state.remove_container access containers and phases correctly? need to test
- test each valid case
- test each error case
- check the logic against the oracle
- assuming the "if attached" statements in the make functions for removeph and removecont work then the undo should be a simple call to new[object] using that saved object from the if attached
- need to review move container logic still 

Notes:
- new_tracker doesnt wipe the board (existing phases stayed), but new_tracker does prevent undo to previous state
- on program start tracker should already exist with values 0,0
- new_tracker still has to wipe history
- when editing error_check make sure to check is_invalid matches with the results of error_check
