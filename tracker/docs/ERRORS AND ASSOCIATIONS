Error messages and their associations (not definitive, tested from oracle):

Implemented/tested:

Implemented/not tested:
New tracker: E1 (new_tracker on tracker with *containers*),E2,E3,E4
New phase: E1,E5,E6,E7,E8
New container: E5,E9,E10,E11,E12,E13,E14,E18
Remove container: E15
Remove Phase: E1 (if there are containers),E9

In progress:
Move container: E9?, E13, E15, E16
Move container also needs its basic functionality still 
Undo for each operation (Redo should ultimately just call the execute method for the respective operation)

Other todo:
- check each execution function
- check each undo function
- check each error
- check the logic against the oracle


Notes:
- new_tracker doesnt wipe the board (existing phases stayed), but new_tracker does prevent undo to previous state
- on program start tracker should already exist with values 0,0
- new_tracker still has to wipe history
- when editing error_check make sure to check is_invalid matches with the results of error_check
