Error messages and their associations (not definitive, tested from oracle):

Implemented/tested:

Implemented/testing:
New tracker: Functionality, Undo,E1 (new_tracker on tracker with *containers*),E2,E3,E4
New phase: Functionality, Undo,E1,E5,E6,E7,E8
New container: Functionality, undo, E5,E9,E10,E11,E12,E13,E14,E18
Remove container: Functionality, undo , E15
Remove Phase: Functionality, undo, E1 (if there are containers),E9
Move container: Functionality, undo, E9, E11, E12, E13, E14, E15, E16, E17

In progress:
- testing the 13 luca tests
Passed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,9

movecontainer checks container validity first
Which means the error codes arent tested in numerical order (move container tests e15 before e9)

- assuming the "if attached" statements in the make functions for removeph and removecont work then the undo should be a simple call to new[object] using that saved object from the if attached


Notes:
- new_tracker doesnt wipe the board (existing phases stayed), but new_tracker does prevent undo to previous state
- on program start tracker should already exist with values 0,0
- new_tracker still has to wipe history
- when editing error_check make sure to check is_invalid matches with the results of error_check
- phases and containers...have to be sorted alphabetically.....
