Undo/Redo for each operation

Other todo:
- check each execution function

Notes:
- new_tracker doesnt wipe the board (existing phases stayed), but new_tracker does prevent undo to previous state

- on program start tracker should already exist with values 0,0

- new_tracker still has to wipe history

- when editing error check make sure to check is_invalid
